# Purpose

This analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of the Automated Camera Enforcement *(ACE)* program on bus performance \ 
in Brooklyn, with a specific focus on routes commonly used by **Brooklyn College** students. The goal is to determine whether \ 
the implementation of ACE has led to improvements in bus speeds and trip times, which are critical factors affecting the \ 
reliability and efficiency of public transportation for daily commuters.
By comparing two ACE-enforced bus routes **(B44 SBS and B41)** with a non-ACE route **(B6)**, we aim to answer the following questions: \ 
- Has the ACE program led to measurable increases in average bus speeds?
- Has there been a reduction in overall trip time on ACE-enforced routes?
- How do these changes compare to bus routes not enforced by ACE?
- Is there a relationship between bus lane violations and changes in performance over time?


The findings of this analysis will help assess the effectiveness of the ACE program in improving public transit, particularly on key routes \
serving Brooklyn College students.
