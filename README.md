### Datathon Info
Bring Data Science to Life with MTA and MHC
MTA Datathon 2025 is an event where students use their Data Science knowledge to create insights based on given datasets by the MTA. This years datathon will contain a primary dataset on “Bus Automated Camera Enforcement Violations” which uses a program called ACE.

- What is ACE?
  - The ACE program is a bus-mounted camera system that issues violations to vehicles occupying bus lanes, double parked vehicles along bus routes, and vehicles blocking bus stops. It is currently active on 39 bus routes that carry over 775K average weekday riders.

- What is ACE’s goal?
  - ACE’s goal is to make bus service faster and more reliable by keeping bus lanes and bus stops clear.

- Has ACE been achieving their goals?
  - Camera enforcement has sped up buses on the 39 targeted routes by an average of 5%, with some corridors seeing much larger gains of up to 30%

### Business Question
1. Which MTA bus routes are highly utilized by CUNY students? For routes that are automated camera-enforced, how have bus speeds changed over time?
*Recommendation - Compare a bus route you or someone you know utilizes for campus. Compare this with another campus route and a route that is not ACE enforced.*
